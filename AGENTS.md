# AGENTS.md – Sprint Dashboard Agent Workspace

## Purpose
You are an AI coding assistant helping build a local **Sprint Dashboard** application.  
The app replaces the single‑file HTML prototype with a proper three‑tier architecture:

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API + `<script setup>` + TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (Node.js, with TypeScript)
- **Database**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`)
- **Charts**: Chart.js with vue-chartjs wrapper

All components run on the developer’s machine – no external hosting needed.

## Agent Guidelines

### 1. Always think in layers
- `backend/` – Next.js application serving REST endpoints and managing database.
- `frontend/` – Vue application that consumes the REST API.
- Do not mix frontend and backend concerns.

### 2. Security first
- The GitHub Personal Access Token is stored **only** on the server (`BACKEND_GH_TOKEN` environment variable).
- Never send the token to the client. The frontend only receives processed data.
- Validate all API inputs on the server (e.g., sprint names, query parameters).

### 3. Code style
- Use TypeScript everywhere (both Vue and Next.js).
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` and composables for logic reuse.
- Backend: use Next.js API routes with proper error handling.
- SQL queries: parameterised, never string‑concatenated.

### 4. Folder structure (proposed)

### 5. Implementation order (when building from scratch)
1. Set up `backend` with SQLite schema (sprint_items, sprints, configurations).
2. Implement GitHub data ingestion (fetch project items, parse, store in DB).
3. Create API endpoints that replicate the logic from the HTML prototype (burndown, velocity, etc.).
4. Set up `frontend` with Vue Router, views for each tab, and connect to API.
5. Add the “expected hours per sprint” global target as a configuration stored in DB.
6. Polish UI (Jira‑style theme) and add caching / scheduled refresh on the backend.

### 6. Reuse existing logic
The HTML prototype contains many calculation functions (`calcActualHours`, `buildBurndown`, etc.).  
When building the backend, refactor them into separate `lib/calculators.ts` modules, adjusting for database queries rather than in‑memory arrays.

### 7. Caching & refresh
- The backend should cache project data in SQLite.
- When the user requests data, serve from DB.
- A manual “Refresh” button (or a cron‑like trigger) re‑fetches from GitHub and updates DB.
- The “Expected Hours per Sprint” setting is persisted in a `config` table.

### 8. Testing
- Use **Vitest** as the testing framework.
- For unit tests requiring a database connection, mock `getDb()` to use an in-memory SQLite instance (`new Database(':memory:')`).
- Initialize the in-memory database in `beforeEach()` by executing `migrations/schema.sql` and manually seed known test data.
- Write integration tests for API endpoints (mocking GitHub if needed).
- Do not over‑engineer; focus on correctness first.

### 9. Project memory
- Always read `docs/memory.md` first — it contains the current state, schema, config keys, API endpoints, KPI thresholds, and implementation status.

### 10. Time Selection and Filtering
- The dashboard supports both Sprint-based and Date Range-based filtering globally/per-view.
- Use the reusable `TimeSelector.vue` component for choosing between Sprint or Date Range modes.
- Frontend views must destructure `selectionMode`, `startDate`, and `endDate` from `useSprintSelector()` and pass them appropriately to API client calls.
- Backend API endpoints must handle both parameters, passing `startDate`/`endDate` (in ISO string format `YYYY-MM-DD`) to calculators when `sprint` is not specified.

### 11. Actual Time Calculation Rules
When modifying business logic for "Actual Time" calculations (currently encapsulated in `backend/lib/calculators.ts` -> `getActualTimeSql`):
- **Sprint Assigned Tasks**: For tasks assigned to a sprint, actual time calculation starts from whichever came *later*: the Sprint's Start Date or the task's first "In Progress" transition date.
- **Ghost Hours Prevention**: Tasks that are in a "To Do" state (i.e., they have no "In Progress" transition and are not "Done") must always accrue **0 hours**, even if they are assigned to an active sprint. Do not allow tasks to accrue elapsed time simply by being in an active sprint.
- **Backlog Tasks**: Tasks without a sprint fall back to the first "In Progress" transition date (or `created_at` if missing).

### 12. Carry Over Calculation Rules
When calculating whether a task is "Carry Over" (encapsulated in `backend/lib/calculators.ts` -> `getIsCarryOverSql`):
- **Carry Over Definition**: A task is considered a carry over if it was created before the sprint start date (`created_at < sprint.start_date || ' 00:00:00'`) OR if it has a transition to "In Progress" prior to the sprint start date.
- **Views Display**: Any view displaying task item lists (e.g. Burndown, Overview, Team, Commitment, Quality, and Timesheet) must show a Jira-style orange badge next to the task title if the task is flagged as a carryover.

## Interacting with the Agent
- When you ask the agent to implement a feature, it will propose changes to both frontend and backend.
- The agent will respect the folder structure and TypeScript conventions.
- If clarification is needed, the agent will ask before making assumptions.

### 13. Native Module Rebuilding for Electron
When installing or updating native modules (such as `better-sqlite3`) in the Electron backend, the module must be rebuilt to match Electron's internal Node.js ABI version. 
Always use the following pattern within the `backend` directory to rebuild:
`npm_config_runtime=electron npm_config_target=30.0.0 npm_config_disturl=https://electronjs.org/headers npm rebuild <MODULE_NAME> --build-from-source`

### 14. Database Schema Verification
When writing, migrating, or modifying SQL queries in the application code (e.g., `ipc-handlers.ts`), you MUST strictly verify the table names, column names, and relationships against the active schema definition in `backend/migrations/schema.sql`. Do not assume legacy column names are correct without checking the schema.

### 15. Project List State Synchrony
The list of projects shown in the top navigation bar (`App.vue`) and settings (`ConfigView.vue`) must be synchronized globally. Always use the shared Vue inject/provide system composables (`useProjects` / `useProvideProjects`) to manage and fetch the project list so that any project modification reactively updates all components.

### 16. UI Terminology Constraints (Hours vs. Points)
Never use "Points" or "Story Points" in the user-facing interface (buttons, headers, inputs, text). Label the modes as "Estimated Hours" (which maps internally to the `points` parameter/effort database column) and "Number of Issues" (which maps internally to the `issues` parameter).

### 17. Electron External Links
All external HTTP/HTTPS links (such as GitHub issues) must open in the user's default browser. Ensure `backend/src/main.ts` maintains listeners for `setWindowOpenHandler` and `will-navigate` on the main window's `webContents` to open them via `shell.openExternal(url)` and prevent them from opening in the Electron window.

### 18. GitHub GraphQL API Ingestion Constraints
When fetching timeline items or status change history via the GitHub GraphQL API:
- Do not query timeline connections (e.g., `timelineItems`) nested inside `ProjectV2` queries, as GitHub silently omits/drops them for newer issues. Instead, fetch the issue/PR content IDs and query them via top-level `nodes(ids: $ids)`.
- When using `nodes(ids: $ids)` with nested connections (like `timelineItems`), **never exceed a batch size of 50**. Requesting larger batch sizes (e.g., 100) causes GitHub's API resolver to silently drop/empty out the nested timeline connections.
